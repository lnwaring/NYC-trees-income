# Trees vs Income in NYC Dashboard

#### Summary

This project explores the relationship between neighbourhood income levels and tree population, density, and health in New York City. The dashboard visualises tree coverage by ZIP code and average income across NYC boroughs. The aim was to investigate whether lower-income areas have disproportionately less access to green space.

#### Tools & Skills Used:
- Tableau
- Data storytelling
- Filtering by geography

#### Key Insights:
- Tree distribution per capita varies widely across NYC, with some wealthier boroughs generally showing greater tree density.
- Several ZIP codes in lower-income areas show limited tree coverage, highlighting potential inequalities in environmental access.
- The dashboard encourages exploration of how public infrastructure and urban planning intersect with income disparities.
